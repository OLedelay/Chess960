        Chess960 is a chess variant created by Bobby Fischer
        (considered to be the greatest chess player of all time).
        Chess960 is just like regular chess, except that the starting
        lineup between your 2 rooks is shuffled in a random order every
        time you start a new game. The purpose of this chess variant was
        to make memorzing chess openings far less useful, forcing the
        player to rely on his/her intuition.
        <br>
        <br>
        The starting position for Chess960 must meet the following requirments:
        <br>
        <ul>
          <li>Pawns are placed on their orthodox home squares.</li>
          <li>All remaining pieces are placed on the first rank.</li>
          <li>The king must be placed somewhere between the 2 white rooks.</li>
          <li>The bishops are placed on opposite coloured squares.</li>
          <li id="d4">The black pieces are placed equal-and-opposite to the white
              pieces. For example, if white's king is placed on b1,
              then black's king is placed on b8.</li>
        </ul>
